# ‚öôÔ∏è General Techniques

* If you find yourself getting lost during coding exercises, try splitting your solution into two parts: Sketch out the solution in any way that makes sense to you (e.g. pseudo-code or natural language), then code that solution. This technique can let you focus on solving separately from coding and spread out the cognitive load.
